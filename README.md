# Speed Test Results to Discord Webhook

This script retrieves speed test results from a Postman API and sends them to a Discord webhook in the form of an embedded message. The script fetches ping, upload, and download speeds from the API response and formats them into a Discord webhook embed with customizable formatting.

Uses Postman API to pull Speedtest Results from https://github.com/alexjustesen/speedtest-tracker
